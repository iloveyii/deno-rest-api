# Deno REST API

> This is a simple REST API using Deno and Oak. I will add Mongo DB and JWT based authentication later.

## Run

```
drun
```

## Routes

```
GET      /api/v1/users
GET      /api/v1/users/:id
POST     /api/v1/users
```

## Test Endpoint

      * Open api.rest file in an IDE (vscode, phpstorm)
      * It has all the implemented routes, click the api run button to see the results.
      * vscode uses a plugin for rest api called {Rest Client}, however Phpstorm has builtin support for .rest files.
